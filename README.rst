Zephyr OS - CANopenNode Sample for Industrial Network Playground
================================================================

This is a copy of, and adaptation of, the Zephyr OS CANopen node example for my hobby project, `Industrial Network Playground <https://hackaday.io/project/193862-industrial-network-playground>`_

The original code can be found here: `canopennode <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/samples/modules/canopennode>`_ The original README can also be found in this repository (`README_original.rst <https://github.com/Trifunik/INP_Zephyr_CANopenNode/README_original.rst>`_) and should be read to understand this example.

The following information refers to my changes and adaptations.
